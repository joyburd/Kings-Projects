# Kings-Projects
Projects Created at King's College London in pursuit of my Master's 2016-2018

These scripts were developed in order to show multiple ways a "fake news detector" could be created. They are not meant to be comprehensive, but were created in order to suggest a few automated forms of anaylsis that could be used to solve a topical problem in 2016.

They MUST be opened in 2.7: they are not compliant with 3.4.
